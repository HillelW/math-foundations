As an example of how bootstrapping works, we will build up a mathematical library of machines by starting with the most primitive machine we can imagine: a machine that adds one to its input and returns the result.   \n",

One example where this occurs is in the context of the long division algorithm. Although most people know the *steps* required to *execute* the long division algorithm, they don’t often *understand* the long division algorithm. \n",

Although most people *do* pass step 1 in the case of long division, they fail on the subsequent steps. In other words, most people do not *understand* the long division algorithm.

What makes the decimal system more powerful than other numeral systems (such as Roman numerals) is that we can solve such problems by only considering *two digits at a time*. In other words, as long as we have already memorized how to add and multiply single-digit numbers, we can solve problems involving arbitrarily large numbers.

    "\n",
    "Recall that multiplication is defined as repeated addition. However, it is often the case that mathematical definitions are not very helpful in practice without some additional help. For example, suppose we want to compute 852× 73. According to the definition of multiplication, this product is equal to 852 + · · ·+ 852 (73 times).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We now take up the question of how to avoid the tedium of adding 852 to itself 73 times in order to compute 852 × 73. \n",
    "Recall that our main technique in the addition and subtraction algorithms was to break one large problem into many smaller problems by exploiting some arithmetic property such as associativity of addition, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that the multiplication algorithm exploits the *distributive property* of multiplication. This property allows us to restrict our attention to only two digits at a time. For this reason, the multiplication algorithm assumes that the entire multiplication table for single digit multiplication has already been memorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distributive property of multiplication states that for any three natural numbers m, n, and l, the following is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "m(n + l) = mn + ml.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that *multiplication distrubutes over addition).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to compute 852 x 3. We begin by expanding each number:\n",
    "\n",
    "852 x 3 = (800 + 50 + 2) x 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we express each number as a product of some power of ten and a single-digit number:\n",
    "\n",
    "852 x 3 = ((8 x 100) + (5 x 10) + 2) x 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the 3 on the outside multiplies three distinct terms. Distributing the 3 to each of the terms yields: \n",
    "\n",
    "852 x 3 = ((8 x 3 100) + (5 x 3 10) + (2 x 3)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "852 x 3 = (24 x 100) + (15 x 10) + 6. \n",
    "852 x 3 = (24 x 100) + ((10 + 5) x 10) + 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how the multiplication algorithm works, we need to proceed slowly in steps of increasingly difficult problems. In particular, we will consider the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The multiplication of an arbitrary number by a single-digit number.\n",
    "2. The multiplication of an arbitrary number by an arbitrary number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, we will show how 852 × 73 can be computed if we separately know how to compute 852 x 3 and 852 x 7.\n",
