    "\n",
    "Recall that multiplication is defined as repeated addition. However, it is often the case that mathematical definitions are not very helpful in practice without some additional help. For example, suppose we want to compute 852× 73. According to the definition of multiplication, this product is equal to 852 + · · ·+ 852 (73 times).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We now take up the question of how to avoid the tedium of adding 852 to itself 73 times in order to compute 852 × 73. \n",
    "Recall that our main technique in the addition and subtraction algorithms was to break one large problem into many smaller problems by exploiting some arithmetic property such as associativity of addition, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that the multiplication algorithm exploits the *distributive property* of multiplication. This property allows us to restrict our attention to only two digits at a time. For this reason, the multiplication algorithm assumes that the entire multiplication table for single digit multiplication has already been memorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distributive property of multiplication states that for any three natural numbers m, n, and l, the following is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "m(n + l) = mn + ml.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that *multiplication distrubutes over addition).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to compute 852 x 3. We begin by expanding each number:\n",
    "\n",
    "852 x 3 = (800 + 50 + 2) x 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we express each number as a product of some power of ten and a single-digit number:\n",
    "\n",
    "852 x 3 = ((8 x 100) + (5 x 10) + 2) x 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the 3 on the outside multiplies three distinct terms. Distributing the 3 to each of the terms yields: \n",
    "\n",
    "852 x 3 = ((8 x 3 100) + (5 x 3 10) + (2 x 3)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "852 x 3 = (24 x 100) + (15 x 10) + 6. \n",
    "852 x 3 = (24 x 100) + ((10 + 5) x 10) + 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how the multiplication algorithm works, we need to proceed slowly in steps of increasingly difficult problems. In particular, we will consider the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The multiplication of an arbitrary number by a single-digit number.\n",
    "2.\tThe multiplication of an arbitrary number by an arbitrary number.  \n",

    "To illustrate, we will show how 852 × 73 can be computed if we separately know how to compute 852 x 3 and 852 x 7.\n",
